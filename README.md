# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a coding exercise. It is a command-line game of Tic-Tac-Toe which
supports both human and computer players. The computer player uses a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to compute the best possible move and it cannot be defeated.

command:

```
Then you can run the game with:
```

```

```
